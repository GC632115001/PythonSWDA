## Problem
1. Session Hijacking Attack
2. Session Fixation Attack


### Solution for Problem 1. 
 Encrypt session data, use strong and unpredictable session IDs, regularly regenerate session IDs, securely store session files, set session timeouts, implement strong user authentication, and keep software updated
### Solution for Problem 2. 
The validation of session IDs should not only include checking the format and length but also verify the existence of the ID.


## Decision Driver
- Code language, implementation methodology, fameworks and libraries, team decision-making.
