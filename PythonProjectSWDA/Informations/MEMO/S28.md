## Problem
- Sessions are not properly managed, leading to security vulnerabilities and potential unauthorized access to user accounts.

### Solution for Problem
- Web development frameworks, such as J2EE, ASP .NET, PHP, and others, provide their own session management features and associated implementation. It is recommended to use these built-in frameworks versus building a home made one from scratch, as they are used worldwide on multiple web environments and have been tested by the web application security and development communities over time.

## Decision Driver
- code language, chosen tools, team cohesion (decision making)
