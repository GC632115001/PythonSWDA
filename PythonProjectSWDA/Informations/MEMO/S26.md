## Problem
- Need authentication and authorization by using API.

### Solution for Problem
- Use OAuth2 for single sign on (SSO) with OpenID Connect. That SSO lets your users verify themselves with a trusted third party (like Google, Microsoft Azure, or AWS) by way of token exchange to get access to a resource. Theyâ€™ll log in to their Google account, for instance, and be granted access to your app.

## Decision Driver
- code language, approachability, chosen tools, team cohesion (decision making)
