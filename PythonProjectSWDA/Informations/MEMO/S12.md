## Problem
1. Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and frameworks
2. Insufficient logging and monitoring
3. Cross-site scripting (XSS)

### Solution for Problem 1. Code review involves reviewing the code written by developers to identify potential security issues
### Solution for Problem 2. Continuous monitoring helps in detecting and responding to security incidents in real-time
### Solution for Problem 3. Developers must adhere to secure coding practices

## Decision Driver
- Secure Software Isn’t a Big Enough Priority, Quality Doesn’t Necessarily Guarantee Security, Not Enough Training for Security
