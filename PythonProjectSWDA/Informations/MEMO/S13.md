## Problem
1. Not treating security as a first-class devops citizen
2. Developing proprietary technical implementations
3. Poor governance and management of open source and commercial components
4. Unfettered access to source code repositories and CI/CD pipelines
5. Securing and managing sensitive data
6. DIY security expertise and solutions



### Solution for Problem 1.
Require ongoing security training for the development team, and require that all newly developed APIs, microservices, integrations, and applications instrument the required security tests in their CI/CD pipelines.
### Solution for Problem 2.
Communicate with product owners, enforce user story development, and leverage third-party technologies.
### Solution for Problem 3. 
Make clear policies, governance procedures, and a multidisciplinary team for technology management.
### Solution for Problem 4. 
Implement automated security testing, avoid access to repositories, and apply the principle of least privilege.
### Solution for Problem 5. 
Adopt data governance, educate on data practices, centralized identity management, and implement data lineage capabilities.
### Solution for Problem 6. 
Seek advice from security experts to identify security challenges effectively.

## Decision Driver
- Prioritization, stakeholders(including third-party), approachability, team cohesion.
