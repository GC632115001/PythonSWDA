1. SQL Injection
2. Encryption Weakness

### Solution for Problem 3. Use a password hashing technique to generate a unique hash of the user's password that could be saved in database.
### Solution for Problem 4. User activity tracking, file integrity monitoring, and network activity logs are examples of monitoring and auditing practices.
