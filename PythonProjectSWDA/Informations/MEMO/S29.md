## Problem
- SQL injection attack

### Solution for Problem
- Using a web application firewall (WAF). While regular network firewalls are put up client-side by organizations to defend users and devices, WAFs are implemented server-side to protect websites and web applications. Barracuda Networks, Cloudflare and F5 are among the best-known providers of commercial WAFs, and there are also free open-source alternatives such as ModSecurity.
## Decision Driver
- code language, approachability, chosen tools, prioritization
