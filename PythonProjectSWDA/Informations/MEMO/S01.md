## title
Avoiding top 10 software security design flaws

## source type
PDF file

## author type

## Date
N/A

## Problem
1. Incorrect trust assumptions
2. an unauthorized entity having access to a system or service that it should not
3. Neglecting to authorize after authentication
4. Poor key management
5. Failure to centralize cryptography

### Solution for Problem 1. 
Make sure all data from an untrusted client are validated
### Solution for Problem 2. 
Implement Principle of Least Privilege 
### Solution for Problem 3. 
Periodically perform authorization as an explicit check
### Solution for Problem 4. 
Strict policy-based controls to prevent the misuse/reuse of keys
### Solution for Problem 5. 
Use Updated and Established Cryptographic Functions, Algorithms, and Protocols

## Decision Driver
implementation methodology, Chosen tools
