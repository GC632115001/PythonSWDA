## Problem
1. Vague requirements
2. Fault is irrelevant
3. Misaligned management
4. Collaboration between each member of the company

### Solution for Problem 1. Introduce specific requirements focused on incremental steps to improving security
### Solution for Problem 2. Security teams should focus on vulnerabilities by evaluating their scope, managing the risks they present, and configuring tools as needed to recognize the problem. In turn, developers should focus on fixing the problem that led to the vulnerability, and leadership needs to hold both groups equally accountable for their roles in security.
### Solution for Problem 3. Executives, directors, and managers need to align their individual verticals and teams by prioritizing the same security goals. 
### Solution for Problem 4. Better collaboration and cautious coding from all parties involved.
