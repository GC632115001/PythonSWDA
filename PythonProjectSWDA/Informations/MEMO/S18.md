## Problem
1. Lack of secure authentication mechanisms.
2. Vulnerabilities due to coding bugs.
3. Insufficient protection against session hijacking.
4. Lack of defense in depth

### Solution for Problem 1. 
Implement strong authentication methods such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
### Solution for Problem 2. 
Conduct testing to identify and address coding bugs. Implement secure coding practices and perform regular code reviews to minimize the introduction of vulnerabilities.
### Solution for Problem 3. 
Implement session management mechanisms, such as setting expiration time for sessions after a period of inactivity.
### Solution for Problem 4. 
Implement multiple layers of security defenses to reduce the likelihood of a successful attack.


## Decision Driver
- Code language, Implementation methodology, team decision-making.
