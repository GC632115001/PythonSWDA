In turn, developers should focus on fixing the problem that led to the vulnerability, and leadership needs to hold both groups equally accountable for their roles in security.",
        "Problem 3.": "Executives, directors, and managers need to align their individual verticals and teams by prioritizing the same security goals.",
        "Problem 4.": "Better collaboration and cautious coding from all parties involved."
